# Fuzzy Tip System

A fuzzy logic system to calculate restaurant tips based on quality and service. This project demonstrates clean code, object-oriented programming (OOP), and type hints.

## Requirements

Install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Usage

Run the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```

This will calculate the tip based on predefined quality and service values and save the graphs in the Images folder.
## Graphs

The membership function graph for the tip calculation is shown below:
### PNG Format

Tip Graph
### PDF Format

The graph is also available in PDF format.
